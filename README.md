## ðŸ©º Stroke Prediction App

### Project Overview

The Stroke Prediction App is a web-based tool built with Python and Streamlit to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on healthcare-related features, including demographics, medical history, lifestyle, and lab values.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with interactive input fields, a colorful and modern interface, and a clear prediction result including risk probability.

### Preprocessing Steps

#### Missing Value Handling

Filled missing bmi values with median

#### Encoding Categorical Variables

gender, ever_married, Residence_type â†’ Label Encoding

work_type and smoking_status â†’ One-Hot Encoding

#### Feature Scaling

StandardScaler applied after SMOTE

#### Skew Correction

Log-transform applied to avg_glucose_level and bmi

#### Outlier Handling

Clipped extreme values for avg_glucose_level and bmi

#### Balancing the Dataset

SMOTE used to handle class imbalance for stroke

### Modeling

#### Models Tested:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier âœ… (Final)

Gradient Boosting

k-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Naive Bayes

#### Performance:

Random Forest achieved the best accuracy and stability.
