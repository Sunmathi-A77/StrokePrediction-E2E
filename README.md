## ðŸ©º Stroke Prediction App

### Project Overview

The Stroke Prediction App is a web-based tool built with Python and Streamlit to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on healthcare-related features, including demographics, medical history, lifestyle, and lab values.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with interactive input fields, a colorful and modern interface, and a clear prediction result including risk probability.

### Preprocessing Steps

**Missing Value Handling**  
- Filled missing `bmi` values with median.

**Encoding Categorical Variables**  
- `gender`, `ever_married`, `Residence_type` â†’ Label Encoding  
- `work_type` and `smoking_status` â†’ One-Hot Encoding  

**Feature Scaling**  
- `StandardScaler` applied **after SMOTE**.

**Skew Correction**  
- Log-transform applied to `avg_glucose_level` and `bmi`.

**Outlier Handling**  
- Clipped extreme values for `avg_glucose_level` and `bmi`.

**Balancing the Dataset**  
- SMOTE used to handle class imbalance for `stroke`.

### Modeling

**Models Tested:**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier âœ… **(Final Model)**  
- Gradient Boosting  
- k-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Naive Bayes  

**Performance:**  
- Random Forest achieved the best accuracy and stability.  
- Feature importance was calculated and visualized.
